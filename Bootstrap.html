        <p>The blue poison dart frog is a small, brightly colored amphibian native to the rainforests of Suriname and Brazil. Its vibrant blue skin, covered in black spots, serves as a warning to predators about its toxicity. These frogs secrete potent toxins through their skin, which they acquire from their diet in the wild. Despite their poisonous nature, they are popular in captivity, where they lose their toxicity due to a different diet.</p>
        <p>The desert rain frog is a small, chubby amphibian found in the coastal sand dunes of Namibia and South Africa. It has a round body, short limbs, and translucent skin that helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. Known for its high-pitched squeaking when threatened, this nocturnal frog spends most of its time buried in the sand. Unlike many frogs, it does not require standing water to survive, relying instead on coastal fog for hydration. </p>
        <p>The Rhacophorus reinwardtii, or black-webbed tree frog, is a vibrant, arboreal species found in Southeast Asia's tropical rainforests. Known for its striking green body, blue sides, and black-webbed feet, it is an excellent glider, using its large toe pads and webbed limbs to leap between trees. This nocturnal frog lays its eggs in foam nests above water, where tadpoles hatch and drop into ponds below. Its strong climbing abilities and camouflage help it evade predators in its lush, forested habitat.</p>
